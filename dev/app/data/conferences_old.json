Here, the proposed presentation is to discuss about a new method of generating code that keeps the code generation advantages and proposes a new innovative approach to develop and deliver code generators, that can be natively configurable and easily extensible and which proposes a full and permanent vision of what is happening internally. Then, a practical implementation will be described and demonstrated, to show that what will be presented is not only a dream and that we can imagine concrete applications within Worldline. Introduing this approach is a must, as it is perfectly adapted to the TEAm program currently settled in Worldline. Indeed, it transcends the code generation paradigm, to provide an even better application industrialization program, while increasing the productivity of applications. This approach ensures that code generators are adaptable to the need, while the classical approaches require the development teams to adapt to the various code generators deployed in their perimeters.","theme":"DEVELOPMENT","title":"A blink to the future of code generation","when":{"start":"13:30","end":"14:15"},"where":4},{"_id":"53450cb856c06970c1000002","author":"Fabien Cellier","bu":"R&D team","day":2,"description":"These last few years, many new exciting projects have emerged for the web to write efficient code in the browser.

Such actions can be triggered by someone using the application, as well as by an automated process that is invoked to integrate information collected during a day. Behind information processing, depending on the application context, we can see that we have more and more matters and concepts, such as the notion of batches, workflow, parallel processing, ETLs, business processes and so on. Definitely, boundaries between them are most of the time hard to see, and it is not obvious whether we should choose one or another in a specific context. The aim of this round table is to come back to the origins,and share about the most up-to-date technologies available within the company as well as the ones on the market. Indeed, we aim at getting into the different notions listed above, to identify their initial targets, what they do, and in which context they are the most efficient. Of course, it is not really efficient if we only address the theory. Hence, with the different notions we plan to address, we will illustrate them with the best suitable tools, in terms of features, documentation and support.

What happens next is that this model alone has to take responsibility for nearly every aspect of our program. However, we tend to think a model in a given use case. The rest of the application’s features have to cope with the model in place. CQRS is an effort to acknowledge the existence of at least two models that can co-exist: One for reading, the other for writing. Imagine a payment application with a backend for admin users: -\tOne model for the real-time (mainly wrinting): Transaction, Account, CardHolder -\tOne model for the admin pages (mainly reading): One table per page. The Real-time model is not polluted with indexes only meant to accelerate the admin pages. The admin pages do not have to cope with 10’s of joins just to get the expected information. Think of how simple a pagination, a filter, even a multicriteria search can be with just one table… There is still the problem of maintaining both models in sync. The good news is that mainly, you don’t need to do it right now. An eventual consistency is usually enough: When a new transaction is processed, it need not appear on the admin page in the exact same second… The same minute might be acceptable. Anyhow, we will link models together with events, mainly because there is another deep notion behind events that we want to take advantage of: “Event sourcing” aka “DB KILLER”. Event sourcing is merely storing what events a system receives as input, and state that this stream of events defines completely our system. Hence, storing the events is just like storing our system. Replaying the stream of events on a blank system will lead to the same state. In fact, storing events is a lot more powerful than merely storing the last known good state, which is what a RDMS does: We will see how to make use of this event log to rebuild a parallel system, to boost performances many folds and to make replication a breeze.","theme":"ARCHITECT., DEV","title":"CQRS & Event Sourcing","when":{"start":"10:40","end":"11:25"},"where":1},{"_id":"534510dc56c06970c1000006","author":"Nicolas Pelloux-Prayer","bu":"PST","day":2,"description":"This session starts with a fact: We are not born code gurus.

Despite all its failures, criticism and the recent struggles faced by the Mt.Gox exchange platform, the Bitcoin crypto currency can be seen as a milestone in the emergence of a real alternative to the established financial industry. In just a few years, the total crypto currency market capitalization has gone from nothing - a few years ago - to more than 7 billion euros (retrieved from http://coinmarketcap.com/#EUR on 12/03/2014). This trend find its roots in several social, political and technical facts : the loss of trust of people towards traditional actors – banks, governments – which has peaked since the 2008 global crisis, the emergence of P2P networks and distributed application, the growth of local and global communities etc. In this presentation, we will first focus on bitcoin, explain how it works, what are its up and downsides. We will then put bitcoin in perspective and explore Ripple – which is the second largest alternative currency market in the world, just after bitcoin. Ripple can be regarded as a distributed clearing and settlement network. The last part of the presentation will focus on the underlying trust model of bitcoin– which rely on trust by proof of work - and of Ripple – which rely on trust by consensus - is truly original. We will explain why these models are so original and how they function. The distributed application model that is promoted by these initiatives raises fundamental questions for Wordline. In the architectures that support these models, no one is trusted and no one needs to be trusted. There is no central authority or trusted third party. If so, then what is in it for companies like Wordline? While no definitive answer to this question can be given as of now, our presentation will try to give the keys to understanding these trends and evaluate the techniques behind these new architectures.","theme":"TRUST, PAYMENT","title":"Community or chaos - bitcoin and the future model of the web","when":{"start":"16:50","end":"17:35"},"where":3},{"_id":"5345115f56c06970c1000007","author":"Sebastien Lacroix","bu":"BFI","day":1,"description":"Multiplication of payments services on internet, linked to the fraud, alerted end users on the risk of identity usurpation. Many users ask for an offer that can secure theirs action on multiple devices. Our solution is a strong authentication method that provides secured services based on our security library. In that way we developed multiple applications based on a single hybrid architecture: Webview / native SDK. The main frameworks used are Cordova, HandleBars and JQuery. We will present the architecture of our Windows Application. The first interesting part of our application is the security library that we called SDK. In our development the SDK project is completely dissociated of the application part. It provides cryptographic API and a safe that can contain sensitive informations. In that way we can authenticate the user. Our SDK contains also a system that detect hostile environment. Associated to the user PIN this set defines our security solution. Another interesting part of the solution, and a must have in bank applications, is the certificate pinning applied at every network call, in that way we avoid man in the middle attacks. Our hybrid choice helps to maintain the application on different platforms. In this purpose we had chosen to develop the graphic interface with HTML5 / Javascript. Moreover we had to determinate a way to communicate with the native part, to do this we take the Cordova implementation on iOS and Android, but the Windows implementation being only in beta, so we had to develop a C#/Javascript wrapper that can handle Cordova calls. Our application structure is non standard but is interesting in a purpose of multiple platform.

Those projects need an optimal connectivity (cost, coverage, availability, flexibility …). More and more clients want an End To End solution and off course a global SLA (including the connectivity). The connectivity is also mandatory to payment acceptance. Today, a mobile device must use the SIM supplied by the telecom operator to communicate (MN0). This makes a very strong link between the device and the MNO. Consequence: to change the connectivity supplier, you have to physically change the SIM, which is costly and needs complex logistics process. There are several reasons to change the connectivity supplier: -\tLow quality of the current MNO -\tAffect the right MNO depending where the device is sold -\tAttach the best local available network depending coverage and costs - Optimized connectivity costs -\t… Some solutions to this problem start to emerge. There are some standardization process with the GSMA and ETSI.

Indeed, information streams growing in size, it's becoming more and more difficult to store informations long enough to process it without causing a bottleneck in the stream. Because these streams are highly fluctuating, it's becoming important to use only necessary ressources at a given time, and not the ressources needed by the highest fluctuations. And more important, the load due to processing requests stream needs to be proportionnally absorbed by allocated ressources. For this purpose, tools have been created allowing to develop an application as a network of processing nodes communicating by stream of messages, instead of a monolithic execution with a central memory. Splitting application into a network of nodes enables to process efficiently the stream without causing any bottleneck in it. In this context, our research focus on web services : an application whose input is a stream of clients requests, which processes it, and then sends back responses to clients as a stream. We study on the one hand, the possibility to automatically transform a web service into multiple processing nodes communicating by messages, and to distribute it on different physical machines, thus avoiding bottleneck. On the other hand, the possibility for these different processing nodes to move from one machine to another, thus making the application dynamicall adapt its ressources to the load. To do so, we propose a new execution model, for web services, based on small processing nodes containing a function, therefore stateless, communicating by messages, the latters being carried by a distributed messaging system. This execution model being dynamically distributed on many physical machines, it would be possible to use ressources according to the exacts needs of the application. Our works aims at providing tools allowing to automate the transformation of a web service written in a classical dynamic functional into this new execution model. Thus abstracting from development, contraints about application scalability. During the TechForum 2014, after a brief introduction to the technical context and the state of the art, I will present the new execution model summarized here, and the state of our works in the field of automatic code transformation.","theme":"CLOUD, DEV.","title":"Liquefy the cloud","when":{"start":"16:50","end":"17:35"},"where":1},{"_id":"5345141856c06941c200000f","author":"Angela Ricci","bu":"MTS","day":2,"description":"When we work on making our devices accessible by the blind, I don’t consider the bloody ROI.” Tim Cook No news: Javascript is here to stay and we can hardly think of a web site -- even the simplest one - without it.

This would enhance user experience through improved resilience to network failure and higher throughput. Multipath TCP is a solution to this issue. Indeed, this transport protocol allows grouping several TCP connections to boost the communication between two end hosts connected to the Internet via several interfaces.

This is crucial to deliver services to end users and it has to be done more and more through devices owned by users themselves. The SEA solution was a first attempt at providing Worldline with a strong authentication using users’ devices. Worldline’s R&D team is working on the next generation of strong authentication solution. It based on a SAAS approach and follows 3 research tracks that we will present: 1 The design of new cryptographic methods to ensure privacy in device fingerprinting – meaning that the server should not learn the user profile. These techniques can be expanded from device fingerprinting to user profiling (physiological and behavioral biometry). 2 The multi device authentication. The idea is to take advantage of the devices wide connectivity - Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS, 3G, or LTE - through specific software components. This will enable easy and transparent communication between devices at the application level and make multi devices authentication possible. 3 The distributed “scoring engine”. A scoring engine can be distributed on the server but also on the different users’ devices. Running a distributed, trusted and privacy by design scoring engine will enable a fine-tuned context aware authentication. With these techniques we witness a paradigm shift to secure user interactions and service delivery. We are moving away from approaches where the user is authenticated based on what he owns and/or knows (PIN code check, secure element …) to approaches where the user is authenticated based on who he is deduced to be. These new approaches are based on fraud detection and scoring applied to the specific context of the interaction. This enables a much more dynamic and thus reactive solution for protecting services from hacking and massive attacks. In the future, we believe that more and more ‘security’ factors will be combined to provide security and seamless user authentication. With the adoption of wearable devices and the deployment of Internet of Things we expect that sensors and devices will be combined together and that the behavioral biometric domain will extend to integrate those inputs… We will show concretely how we can integrate laptop’s webcam to perform basic face recognition to contribute to the scoring of transaction, accelerometer integration to enhance user interactions, etc","theme":"CRYPTOGRAPHY, TRUST","title":"ACE- the next generation of strong authentication ","when":{"start":"11:00","end":"11:45"},"where":4},{"_id":"5345149c56c06941c2000011","author":"Asmae El Ghazi, Julien Jimenez, Stéphane Cauchie","bu":"SANTEOS","day":1,"description":"This demo session is closely related to the HCE presentation also submitted.

When you are confirming a payment, you generally enter your PIN (personal identification number), or in some cases, the merchant enters the PAN of your credit card. This information is entered in the terminal via its user interface but must be kept confidential for payment applications. Imagine if some malicious persons can have access to this information! I think you wouldn’t live this experience … This presentation will be split in two parts. The first part will give you an overview of the problematic, what are the user interface capabilities of a recent terminal and what are the challenges a terminal must success to be compliant with the PCI PTS security rules. The second part will focus on the solution. I will explain how we design the architecture of our terminals to be compliant with these security rules but also be able to provide advanced user interface experience. My biography I’m working on solution for our electronic payment terminals for Wordline (Belgium) since 10 years. I’ve started as a developer on electronic credit and debit payment solutions. Next I was working on the architecture of electronic payment solution and now I’m coordinating technically what we call “the platform”. It’s the base block of our terminal providing to our customer a framework on top of the hardware to easily integrate their payment solutions into our terminals. The platform team is among other things responsible to certify the terminal against the PCI PTS rules and to provide high level API so that the customer’s solution can exploit the user interface of our different terminals.","theme":"TRUST, USER XP","title":"Payment terminals: User interface against security","when":{"start":"11:50","end":"12:35"},"where":1},{"_id":"534514f956c06941c2000013","author":"Maxime Rafaillac","bu":"PST","day":1,"description":"The « Stash my data up! » is a project based on knowledge sharing used to build a common platform!

With the increasing use of smartphones in businesses (BYOD), in the financial industry and other areas where high risk transactions are performed, securing the smartphone applications has become a major challenge. In 2013, Samsung has introduced a new security platform for mobiles named Knox. KNOX is a solution which addresses the mobile security needs of enterprise IT for their mobile applications and data. In this presentation we will propose a thorough review of the Knox technology. We will first identify the different similar and ongoing initiatives in the industry (TEE). We will then focus on the description of Knox 1.0 and Knox 2.0: the Knox container, which is an Android environment within the device; the ODE (On-Device Encryption). We will also discuss the features of VPN application that isolates business data in transit. Then we will talk about its mechanism to check the integrity of the boot code and the OS kernel. And finally we will introduce the TIMA architecture (TrustZone-based Integrity Measurement Architecture) which monitors the kernel for tampering and prevents unauthorized changes while the device is running. TIMA is based on ARM TrustZone technology which will be also explained and where we can store critical parts from applications such as a secure keyboard for PIN entry.

Google is best known for that kind of business. If a company needs full text search for their document collections they’ve two options. Either they implement their own solution using for example the NoSQL database Lucene with its extensions Solr or Elasticsearch or they send their document collections into cloud services like smartdata.io. But there are also companies that don’t want to deal with IT problems and want to store everything in the cloud except sensitive data. What should companies do, that want to store sensitive data into the cloud? This data has to be encrypted in such a way, that it is still searchable. Is it possible to search in encrypted text? Not if it’s encrypted with encryption algorithms like AES. That’s why it’s encrypted. The result is only random bytes without any patterns that occur in the plain text. But if this text is prepared properly, it can be both secure and searchable. In the literature that’s called Secure Index or Searchable Symetric Encryption and research about it is done since around 2000. Different solutions exist that all have their positives and negatives in search time, indexing time and disk space consumption. At Worldline there exists also a prototype implementation of this kind of technology.

This is especially true for online payment but also in the broader field of digital identity. SEA is a strong authentication solution launched within Worldline 5 years ago. It is based on an application installed on the devices of users (smartphone, desktop, etc). This solution aims at authenticating a user by proving that he owns a device, an application and a secret (a PIN). In order to do so, the application checks the device through “device fingerprinting” techniques. We have decided to extend the notion of fingerprint to various personal characteristics whose scope can go from a list of contacts to an OS version or GPS coordinates. In practice, fingerprints are extracted by the application installed on the user’s device and values or hashes are sent to an authentication server. Since these values are user’s personal data, we aim to find a way to prevent the server from being aware of these values, in order to be privacy and/or CNIL compliant while still being able to authenticate efficiently users. Furthermore, we have to tolerate variation of fingerprint values since a user must be able to slightly change his behavior and still being authenticated. Indeed, being privacy compliant and dealing with variable fingerprint in the same time is one of our main challenges; there is currently no known method to optimally fulfill both of these objectives. In this context, we use a cryptographic primitive called fuzzy extractor to (partially) address this issue. A fuzzy extractor acts twofold: It outputs a (pseudo-)random secret s extracted from a user initial fingerprint and a public value P. It recovers the secret s when the user provides to the fuzzy extractor the public value P and another fingerprint value which is close to the initial fingerprint value. In this session, we will see how we managed to use existing fuzzy extractors and what we have yet to do to turn this powerful theoretic tool into an optimal tool to respond our long term issue which is to deal with biometry while being privacy compliant. We will first recall the context of SEA. Then we will give an overview of fuzzy extractors and the benefits they bring in our authentication protocol and more particularly in the field of privacy. Finally, we will highlight future challenges.","theme":"CRYPTOGRAPHY, TRUST","title":"Strong authentication using fuzzy extractors ","when":{"start":"16:00","end":"16:45"},"where":3},{"_id":"5345161f56c06941c2000016","author":"Dalila HATTAB","bu":"BFA","day":1,"description":"White paper on Computational Finance published in November 2011. Explore Paper: Trend analysis of time series is an important problem since trend identiﬁcation enables the prediction of the near future. Much of the data in different fields, that are generated in the operational side of a business have a built-in time dimension. Such time stamped data could be about customer purchases, supplier’s delivery, financial transactions in a bank, or any organization’s activity that is measured and captured over a time period. One of the challenges of doing data mining using such time-series data is the complexity of handling a large number of times series. Times series clustering provides a way to reduce this complexity by finding similarities and categorizing them into smaller subset. Profiling such clusters allow to forecast the future time-series trends and trajectories and subsequently help to generate additional business insights. For example, in the financial market area, the advanced analysis involved through times series help investors to get a more accurate global view of what is happening now in the market and consequently a highest quality of the decision taken. Moreover, several areas could be leveraged by this generic time series analyzer tool: •\tProject Quality development analysis as a software engineering Tools. •\tMachine and sensor data in the context of connected machines/connected vehicles to improve productivity and profitability. •\tEnergy and utilities to detect and reduce energy losses. •\tFinancial services to reduce the risk and increase the performance. •\tHealth care and epidemiology to provide a dynamic view of a population’s health status.

They are mainly based on twins ARM processors, one for the user space and the other for the security functions (sensible data – PIN and PAN –; keys management; chip, MSR and NFC control). Due to the independencies of those processors, the architecture offers to us a very high security. In fact, they run kernels (Linux on user spare, Ecos on security space) which are completely separated for memory and interrupts point of view. In fact in POS environment, the security of the terminal is the starting point of the transaction chain. Some strict rules are defined by PCI (Payment Card Industry) and must be followed for all POS terminals to protect all sensible data. They must be secured form the beginning. That’s why the card devices, the display and the keyboard are directly connected to the security processor. The aim is to offer a level of protection strong enough to avoid compromising the cardholder data (PIN and PAN) and the sessions keys used to protect them. But making our processor have a very high cost, that’s why for our future platform, we will use a more common technology, a processor base on the TrustZone technology from ARM. This is new with currently only few applications and with very low experiences and very low documentation about how to use the technology. The common usage of the TrstZone technology is based usually on synchronous function for specific cryptographic behavior, like a cryptographic coprocessor. Our approach will be completely different. If we look at the ARM documentation, it should be possible to have some interrupts controlled exclusively by the TrustZone part. So, even if it is challenging, our goal is to use this technology to the limit. We would like to reuse our experience of bi-processor architecture and applied it to this new technology: we absolutely want to have asynchronous tasks on the TrustZone part. The presentation will explain the analogies between technology, the challenges and difficulties of the new one and summarize our architecture choices against this, taking into account the PCI rules. My biography I’m working on solution for our electronic payment terminals for Wordline (Belgium) since 14 years. I’ve started as a developer on the cryptographic function for different payment schemes. Next I was in charge of the security software of all SAMOA family terminals, as developer but also to adapt the architecture to follow the evolution of the PCI rules.

Most of the time, the work to do is important and cannot be handled by a simple machine. At least we can dispatch on several processors of a server, but what if there are not enough processors in the server? What if we only have numerous machines with low available cpu? In the presentation, we will make a presentation of the JPPF framework. Then, we will describe how we used it for our needs in archiving platform. If possible, we will make some demonstration of the product. In a last part, some prospective on how to integrate it in our cloud platform will be studied. JPPF is a java framework that eases at its maximum how to parallelize tasks on a grid. It provides a complete java API to create jobs and send them to nodes where they will be executed. Nodes are java processes we can install easily on the targeted server without specific deployment, as all classpath dependencies are automatically loaded through the network. Default configuration allows to start a working grid in some minutes, but many parameters exist. In some slide we will describe the framework, how to use it and how to install a jppf grid. If we find an easy way to make it visible, a demo of deployment of a grid will be done with dispatch of simple jobs. The idea is to use the laptops of some person in the audience. In a second part we will make a short presentation of minions a light weight tool we developed using JPPF and some other open sources. We will explain why it is light, how we use it and its current limitation.
