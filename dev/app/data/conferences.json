[{"description":"This talk will be about the result of our working group dedicated to user behaviour analysis. User behaviour analysis is a domain that impacts or will impact a majority of services developed by Worldline (Wallet, CRM360, Mails services, …) and that must be treated with privacy concerns. \r\n\r\nWe will begin with a state of the art issued from both academic and industrials studies presenting the domain. And then we will present the two tracks we are following :\r\n\r\n1- Data identification & collection: We have worked on identifying what kind of data we will be able to use. Aside from server's data (logs of mail, wallet, ...) we have identified that client terminals (laptop, smartphone, tablet, tv, connected vehicle) are a powerful data source. We will present two aspects; firstly what behaviors can be extracted from what data and secondly we will focus on optimizing data extraction (e.g. minimizing the battery consumption, network bandwith). \r\n\r\n2- Use case : Fraud management for the Trusted Authentication solution:  We have worked on identifying which use case could lead our research to a Proof of Concept. We found that study fraud detection for the Trusted Authentication solution (Authentication method that is embedded inside banks applications) is an interesting case because we had to find a way to plug an fraud detection engine (we think to use Guard developed for mail abnormality detection) while respecting privacy of the end users. We will present what we have and how it can be embedded inside existing works.\r\n","title":"User behaviour analysis for Worldline services","author":"Cyrille D'halluin,Jean Baptiste Lanel,Florent Lemaire,Maxime Peron,Stéphane Cauchie,","when":{"start":"11:10","end":"11:55"},"bu":"ssm","theme":["behaviour"],"_id":"54ff22c2eec2a09a3510fbbe","where":1,"day":"1"},{"description":"The future is going to be different.

One processor was dedicated to the payment logic of a transaction (the application processor) and the other had to assure the security of the transaction (security processor). The new generation of Worldline Payment terminals will no longer be based on such a dual architecture but on a single core processor solution with Arm Trustzone. Instead of a separate security processor there will be by a secure kernel running in a special, trusted mode of the processor.  This presentation will describe the generic architecture of this solution. It will describe how the hardware protections are integrated in the secure kernel, how the security algorithms are protected and how the sensitive data is protected. It will also explain how a “root of trust” is built starting from the boot of the processor until all actors are running.  We will show how Android can be used as a trusted platform for payment applications in a POS device.\r\nThis presentation is a follow-up of last year presentation \"TrustZone in POS environment \" which was presented by Christophe Cavigneaux .\r\n\r\nAbout Mark Vanophalvens.\r\nMark has been working for more than 25 years in embedded systems.

Most implementations of Javascript present an event-loop design.\r\nNode.js is an example. We believe this design is more efficient to build web applications than the classical thread approach. We argue that an event-loop is a pipeline executing on a single-core. It relieves the developer from the synchronization burden, and is linearly scalable.  But it limits the implementation to a single machine. Physics currently prevents us from building CPU with faster clocks. So, when the desired throughput augments, the machine struggles and the average latency increases. \r\nEventually, the only solution to keep a reasonable latency is to use multiple machines. A particularly efficient design to leverage this parallelism is to slice an application into stages to form a parallel pipeline. However, slicing an application into stages is a costly operation when done manually. Every stage must be balanced to fit on a machine so as to avoid bottlenecks leading to wasted resources. Moreover, for important changes in the application, the slicing must be reconsidered to keep the balance.\r\nWe propose to automatically isolate stages in the application logic. The resulting application can be distributed over a network of machines. We believe this work will later allow to automatically balance stages to maximize throughput with the available resources. \r\nAn event loop invokes handlers to react on events. Handlers end without return, they asynchronously trigger the next handlers. The call stacks of two handlers are disjoints. Thus, it is possible to parallelize their execution, as long as causality is preserved. Every event handlers becomes a stage in the pipeline. \r\nIn a mono-thread execution model like Node.js, the memory is global. The atomic execution of handlers removes the need for synchronization and isolation. The memory holds both the communications between the handlers, and their state. To parallelize the handlers, we isolate the state of each handler to reproduce exclusivity; and we identify their communications to reproduce a one way flow of messages.\r\nWe built a first incomplete compiler as a proof of concept. After successful results with custom applications, we are building a complete compiler to transform real applications.","title":"Automatic pipeline parallelism for event-loops","author":"Etienne Brodu,","when":{"start":"15:30","end":"16:15"},"bu":"HPV","theme":["Event loops"," pipeline parallelism"," Javascript"," node.js"," compilation"],"_id":"55001bddeec2a09a3510fbc2","where":3,"day":"2"},{"description":"You may have heard a lot about Apache Spark®, for example that it is the most active open source project in the Big Data Ecosystem which broke the previous Hadoop-based Terasort record by 30 times.

For each new business case we have to buy a specific subscription with network setup fee and monthly fee… with strong commitment that prevent us from changing mobile operator.\r\nOur main pain is that there is not any cost synergy between the different business cases.\r\nTomorrow thanks to CMDE (Connected Machine Data Enabler), for new customers, Telecom services will be provided without a long commercial and technical integration process. Our solution is off-the-shelf for a worldwide coverage. CMDE network is a full Telecom Core Network including GGSN/PGW, HLR/HSS, SMSC, Voice core capability. The Core Network is distributed among 2 different sites in load sharing mode and redundant to each other in term of size capacity. This Core Network gives us the possibility to provide our own SIM cards, while we buy network capacity from  established operators. This way, we can remove the strong dependency to the mobile operators.\r\nIn addition to CMDE, we give the opportunity to our client to use  “eUICC” SIM card compliant with GSMA standard. The amazing advantage of “eUICC” is the capability to change operator or make the card evolve  without accessing the SIM card physicaly which is a particularly costly operation in our current projects. Our Automotive customers represent the main target use case for this by standardized the car or truck factory delivery.\r\nAnother solution proposed to our customer is the Multi IMSI, that allow a truck or cab driver for instance to choose a mobile network while  roaming. It permits to benefit local price or to get a better Quality of Service.\r\nThe above mentioned solutions are connected to the famous Worldline M2M service platform so called “Connected Living”.\r\nThose solutions enrich our Worldline M2M/IoT portfolio and will give the opportunity to the Business Units to generate more margins on E2E Services and provide innovative solution to get more market share and reinforce our position with the existing ones!\r\nIn this presentation, we will introduce the technical platform that we are building to deliver the business promise of CMDE.

The main way of protecting sensitive information is to encrypt them using cryptographic keys. However, this only replaces the problem of \"protecting data\" by the problem of \"protecting keys\". If keys are stored unprotected on a PC/server, anyone with some kind of access to that machine can very easily gain access to their clear value, which in turn would compromise the encrypted data.\r\n\r\nIn order to tackle this problem, one can use a Host Security Module (HSM) attached to the PC/server, to safely store those keys, and use them without divulging their clear value outside the HSM to anyone but dedicated security officers. All of this while offering high level of performance, robustness and of course security.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will be focused on ADYTON, the HSM developed within Worldline. After a small introduction on the product itself, we will give a brief description of its internal architecture. We will then follow by presenting, how one can concretely integrate ADYTON into an application using standard APIs such as HTTP and/or PKCS#11.\r\n\r\n\r\nBiography\r\n\r\nCédric Meuter is a software architect working mainly in the HSM team within the Technologies & Products division in Brussels.

Instead of having one hadoop cluster per customer, which is far from optimal in terms of administration and resource optimization, we would like to have mutualized hadoop clusters, where storage and computing resources are shared between customers.

FIDO Alliance defines open, scalable and interoperable set of mechanisms provided by two sets of specifications Universal Second Factor (U2F) and Universal Authentication Framework (UAF). \r\nIn the first part of this talk we will present the building blocks and the functionality of the Universal Authentication Framework (UAF) protocol. In this protocol, the user registers their device to a relying party by choosing a local authentication mechanism (PIN, Fingerprint, etc ..). To be authenticated by the relying party, the user simply repeats the local authentication action.\r\nIn the second part of the talk we will explain how we integrate FIDO UAF protocol in our protocol ACE (Authentication with Continuous Experience). Our idea is to use ACE to check the user and then unlock a secret key that will be used to produce a UAF signature. The server receives the signature and checks its validity, and then it returns a verification result.\r\n","title":"Trusted Authentication and FIDO","author":"Slim Bettaieb,","when":{"start":"14:50","end":"15:35"},"bu":"","theme":["ACE TA Authentication fido"],"_id":"54fdcd69eec2a09a3510fbae","where":2,"day":"1"},{"description":"Version Control System (VCS) – also called source control or revision control – is a big and complicated subject, but the point of it is easily enough explained:\r\n\r\n- A version control system remembers the history of your files.

Many major M2M projects have been initiated or are about to be launched. These projects are strategic for Worldline development. Moreover, the recent finalization of the Worldline’s CMDE (Connected Machine Data Enabler) connectivity offer will lead, without a doubt, to new opportunities and project perspectives. Then, different specificities and various issues will come with those projects. Some of them, including mobile connectivity diagnosis or mobile data networks architecture were already presented in precedent TechForum eXplore talks. \r\n\r\nHowever, until now, the energy problematic on M2M cellular communications remains misunderstood, and this issue may become very critical when focusing on projects incorporating battery-powered M2M cellular devices.  Several innovative works and researches have proved that the energy drain of a mobile cellular device (smartphones, telemetry devices, etc.) could be efficiently controlled with setting appropriate policies on the priority, the amount and the frequency of data communications. These policies could be integrated in the development processes enhancing in the same way lifetime of the cellular mobile device.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I will present an overview of the energy consumption issue in cellular M2M communications. Specifically, resulting from our investigations, I’ll describe the main reasons causing a critical energy drain for M2M device’s battery. Afterward, based on a consequent number of experimentations and studies which we performed, I will give hints and recommendations toward M2M application development in order to expand battery lifetime and mitigate the energy limitation.

In this paper, we propose an original Cloud network architecture aiming at improving the resiliency of Cloud network infrastructures interconnecting remote datacenters. The main originality of this architecture consists in exploiting the principles of Software Defined Networking (SDN) in order to adapt the rerouting strategies in case of network failure according to a set of requirements. In existing Cloud networks configurations, network recovery after a fiber cut is achieved by means of the usage of redundant bandwidth capacity preplanned through backup links. Such an approach has two drawbacks. First, it induces at a large scale a non-negligible additional cost for the Cloud Service Providers (CSP). Second, the pre-computation of the rerouting strategy may not be suited to the specific quality of service requirements of the various data flows that were transiting on the failing link. To prevent these two drawbacks, we propose that CSPs deploy their services in several redundant datacenters and make sure that those datacenters are properly interconnected via the Internet. For that purpose, we propose that a CSP may use the services of multiple (typically two) Internet Service Providers to interconnect its datacenters via the Internet. In practice, we propose that a set of \"routing inflection points\" may form an overlay network exploiting a specific routing strategy. We propose that this overlay is coordinated by a Software Defined Networking-based centralized controller. Thus, such a CSP may choose the network path between two datacenters the most suited to the underlying traffic QoS requirement. The proposed approach enables this CSP a certain independency from its network providers.

Socketplane (http://socketplane.io/) which has been bought by Docker inc, or Weave (https://github.com/zettio/weave) address lacks or propose alternative to the initial set of Pipework scripts proposed by some Docker team members (https://github.com/jpetazzo/pipework). Besides, some people tend to use OpenVSwitch in relationship with Docker to control container networking (http://wiredcraft.com/blog/multi-host-docker-network/). This use of OpenVSwitch opens the door to a software-defined control of container networking which will trigger a set of innovative use cases.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, Aurélien and I are going to introduce you to those solutions and compare them from an architecture and performance point of view.

But working on performance can often be pushed off until the end of a development cycle, or even worse, to production phase.\r\nWhy do teams delay on performance?...  It’s because performance testing is a strange animal: difficult to specify, difficult to test, and difficult to measure.  What’s more challenging is that performance of an application changes from R&D to production stage and from mobile to PC.  Furthermore, performance involves many different stakeholders, including product or project managers, developers, testers, and operations, but in many cases, there is no one accountable for the End-to-End performance of an application.\r\nIn our presentation, we will guide you on how to deal with performance early in the software development cycle, and how to involve all parties so that performance becomes a continuous goal from the first development cycle until the live application.\r\n\r\nSpecifically you will learn:\r\n\r\n- Challenges with performance testing in an Agile environment\r\n- How to specify accurate performance requirements that can be accepted by all stakeholders and how to synchronize application performance indicators between Business, R&D and Operations\r\n- Methodology to support continuous performance testing and monitoring from the first development cycle until the live application.\r\n- Recommended best practices for testing app performance every iteration\r\n- Quickly and efficient designing tests\r\n- Collaborate on performance testing projects\r\n- Automating test execution and quick pass/fail status on SLAs\r\n\r\nThe presentation is based on feedback and best practices accumulated from real-life performance testing and monitoring from a variety of industries and applications.","title":"Continuous Performance Testing in Agile and DevOps Environments","author":"Henrik  Rexed,","when":{"start":"14:50","end":"15:35"},"bu":"","theme":["Load testing"," performance Testing"," Agile Testing"," DevOps"," Continuous Integration"," Test Automation"],"_id":"55083546eec2a09a3510fbed","where":4,"day":"1"},{"description":"Reusability is one of the hardest goals to achieve in our industry.
